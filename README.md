# Hello, World!

This is a small collection of hello world programs. Not all of these are made in a programming language, and some may require extra files, which is why they are stored in folders.

For example, css requires html, C++ needs to be compiled, and languages such as gambas and gdscript require a whole
project to work.

Some of these are not programming languages, such as libreoffice, text and minecraft (which simply shows a command which can be pasted
into the game.)

I named my first commit Hello, World!. While git is not a programming language, I consider this to be hello world in the form of a commit.


There is also a hello world program in the form of a mostly empty folder(it has an empty text file to make git detect it.)

It is to be noted that I only use the following version of hello world, with a capitalized world, comma and exclamation mark:
Hello, World!
